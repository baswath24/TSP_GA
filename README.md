# TSP_GA
This is a genetic algorithm for travelling salesman problem. The algo is divided into various modules one for each operation for e.g., cross-over,mutation,selection. So, one can change various operators independently and study their behaviour. This algo helps people to study behaviour of genetic algorithm on travelling salesman problem for varied parameters. One can vary parameters through UI and progress of solution through generations is shown through a graph.

## Packages Installation
Install packages required for the program by running the following commands
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install.
```bash
pip install tkinter #only for python 2.7 and older versions
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
```
## Usage
Ensure that python3 is installed.
Clone the repository locally.
Move to the root directory and run: python3 population.py

## Upgrading
One can fork this repository and can change operators in respective python modules for executing different operators.
